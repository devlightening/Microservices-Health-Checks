# Microservices Health Checks Project

This project demonstrates how to implement **health checks and monitoring** for microservices using **.NET 8**, **HealthChecks.UI**, and databases such as **Redis**, **PostgreSQL**, **MSSQL**, and **MongoDb**.  
The goal is to build resilient microservices that expose `/health` endpoints and are monitored via a central **Monitoring Service** with a user-friendly dashboard.

---

## üöÄ Features

- Microservices with individual health check endpoints:
  - `ServiceA`  
  - `ServiceB`  
- **MonitoringService** with HealthChecksUI for centralized monitoring.
- Health checks for:
  - **Redis**  
  - **PostgreSQL**  
  - **MSSQL**  
  - **MongoDB** (optional)
- Custom UI theme with logo and colors.
- Visualization of **healthy/unhealthy** states in the HealthChecksUI dashboard.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies

- **.NET 8** (ASP.NET Core Web API)  
- **HealthChecks.UI**  
- **Redis**  
- **PostgreSQL**  
- **MSSQL**  
- **Docker** (optional for containerized setup)

## üì∏ Screenshots & Scenarios

### 1. Redis stopped
When Redis service is stopped, the health check fails:

In the HealthChecksUI dashboard, the failure is also displayed:

---

### 2. Redis restarted
After Redis is restarted, it is automatically detected as healthy again and shown in the **Database Failures Table**:

When Redis is stopped, it also appears in the failure table:

---

### 3. PostgreSQL stopped
If PostgreSQL is unavailable, the microservice health check reports it as **Unhealthy**:

This is also reflected in the Monitoring UI:

---

### 4. MSSQL database health check
The HealthChecksUI also monitors MSSQL connections and reports failures or healthy status:

---

### 5. Redis execution history
The UI provides detailed execution entries and history for Redis health checks:

---

## üîç How It Works

1. Each microservice exposes a `/health` endpoint.  
2. The MonitoringService collects health check data from microservices.  
3. Results are displayed in the **HealthChecksUI dashboard**.  
4. Failures are logged in a **Database Failures Table**, with automatic recovery detection.  

---

## üì¶ Running the Project

- Run the services locally (`dotnet run`) or with **Docker Compose**.  
- Access the health endpoints:  
  - `http://localhost:7092/health` ‚Üí ServiceA  
  - `http://localhost:7127/health` ‚Üí ServiceB  
- Access the monitoring dashboard:  
  - `http://localhost:7039/health-ui`  

---

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

This project shows how to **monitor distributed services** in real time, identify unhealthy dependencies (databases, caches), and display their status in a clear dashboard.  
It demonstrates failure scenarios (stopping Redis/PostgreSQL) and recovery (restarting services) with full UI integration.
